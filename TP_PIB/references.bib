Data was used for standard/non-standard (S-NS) plane classification, a key step for NT measurement and Down Syndrome assessment. An external dataset with 156 images from the Longhua branch of Shenzhen People’s Hospital was also provided to test AI performance. Annotations for nine key structures (thalami, midbrain, palate, 4th ventricle, cisterna magna, nuchal translucency (NT), nasal tip, nasal skin, and nasal bone) could be found in ObjectDetection.xlsx file.},

	abstract = {Parameters of the fetal nuchal translucency (NT) are very important for the diagnosis and evaluation of fetuses. Currently these parameters are manually measured from the fetal ultrasound image, which may introduce problems of the variability and reproducibility. Here an automatic scheme is proposed to estimate fetal NT parameters. With a morphologic filtering, this scheme firstly establishes the edge map and extracts a preliminary contour by the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake. Then an algorithm based on the dynamic programming is proposed to compound the edge map and the preliminary contour to obtain the NT contour. Finally, parameters of the NT such as the NT thickness and the NT area are calculated. From the application, it is seen that this scheme simultaneously overcomes problems of discontinuousness and concavities in the contour extraction and parameters of the fetal NT can be automatically calculated.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the significance of fetal nuchal translucency at 10-14 weeks' gestation in the prediction of abnormal fetal karyotype.
DESIGN: Prospective screening study.
SETTING: The Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine, King's College Hospital, London.
SUBJECTS: 827 fetuses undergoing first trimester karyotyping by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of chromosomal defects.
RESULTS: The incidence of chromosomal defects was 3\% (28 of 827 cases). In the 51 (6\%) fetuses with nuchal translucency 3-8 mm thick the incidence of chromosomal defects was 35\% (18 cases). In contrast, only 10 of the remaining 776 (1\%) fetuses were chromosomally abnormal.
CONCLUSION: Fetal nuchal translucency {\textgreater} or = 3 mm is a useful first trimester marker for fetal chromosomal abnormalities.},
